<ul>
    <li>you are at least 13 years old and over the minimum age required by the laws of your country of residence to access and use the Platform;</li>

If the changes, in our reasonable discretion, are material, we will notify you by sending an email to the address associated with your Account.</p>

    <p>By continuing to access or use the Platform on or after the Effective Date of the revised Terms, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you must stop accessing and using our Platform before the changes become effective.</p>


<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">3.	Your right to use the Platform</h3>

    <p>Our services constitute a platform where users can exchange messages with one another on topics of their interest and offer reward to participants they deem helpful.</p>

    <p>Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, we grant you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited right to access and use the Platform. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you by these Terms.</p>

    <p>Except and solely to the extent such a restriction is impermissible under applicable law, you may not, without our written agreement:</p>
<ul>
    <li>license, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the Platform;</li>
    <li>modify, prepare derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any part of the Platform; or</li>
    <li>access the Platform in order to build a similar or competitive website, product, or service.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are always improving our Platform. This means we may add or remove features, products, or functionalities; we will try to notify you beforehand, but that won’t always be possible. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Platform (in whole or in part) at any time, with or without notice to you. Any future release, update, or other addition to functionality of the Platform will be subject to these Terms, which may be updated from time to time. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Platform or any part thereof.<p></p>

    <p>You may not use more than one account to access and use the Platform. In the event that your account becomes inaccessible to you, you must notify us at <a href="mailto:support@lumiask.com">support@lumiask.com</a> before using a new account to access and use the Platform.</p>

    <p>You are solely responsible for the information associated with your account and anything that happens related to your account.

    <p>You may not share, lend, sell, license or transfer your account without our prior written approval.</p>


<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">5. Your Content</h3>

    <p>The Platform may contain information, text, links, graphics, photos, videos, audio, streams, or other materials in any media form (“Content”), including Content created with or submitted to the public and/or non-public part of the Platform by you or through your Account (“Your Content”). We take no responsibility for, and we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, support, or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any of Your Content.</p>

    <p>By submitting Your Content to the Platform, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within these Terms. Because you alone are responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to liability if you post or share Content without all necessary rights.</p>

If so, you must not attempt to re-submit or re-send the relevant Content.</p>

<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">7. Your Interactions with other Users</h3>

    <p>You accept that we have no obligation to vet or monitor Users or their Content. We do not endorse or recommend any Users. You rely on such information and/or deal with other Users at your own risk. We accept no legal responsibility for the accuracy of, or otherwise in relation to, any such Content or in connection with any dealings between Users. It is your responsibility to carry out careful and detailed investigations before dealing with other Users including use of or reliance on their Content. You should not assume that any Content from another User is accurate and be aware that a person may not be who he or she claims to be.</p>

    <p>You acknowledge that in using the Platform you may encounter behaviour or Content which you consider inappropriate. If so, please contact us at us at <a href="mailto:support@lumiask.com">support@lumiask.com</a>. Please also use any available blocking mechanisms, seek relevant external help If appropriate (e.g. from law enforcement authorities) and/or stop using the Platform.</p>


<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">8. Payments</h3>

    <p>You acknowledge that payments are processed via a third party payment processing service and will be subject to the applicable terms and conditions offered by such third party.</p>

    <p>For refunds of unspent credits purchased by you via a valid payment method, you must notify us at <a href="mailto:support@lumiask.com">support@lumiask.com</a> within 30 calendar days of your purchase. We will not refund credits spent by mistake.</p>

    <p>For payments to you in exchange for credits you earned through rewards, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@lumiask.com">support@lumiask.com</a> to make a request for payment. The amount to exchange must exceed a minimum threshold of US $10.</p>

    <p>By making a request for payment, you acknowledge that:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>we may seek to verify your identity and request for more information before accepting your request;</li>
    <li>we reserve the right to reject a request for payment if we have reason to believe that your activities are in breach of our Terms;</li>
    <li>you are responsible for any fees and costs arising from the payment, including any processing or other fees charged by banks / payment processors, as determined by us at our sole discretion;</li>
    <li>in the event of delays or other outcomes due to actions taken by our and/or your financial service provider, while we endeavour to offer our full assistance and cooperation to resolve the issue, we are not responsible for their decisions and actions taken in relation to such payments;</li>
    <li>unless otherwise specified by law, you are responsible for all taxes (including but not limited to the tax amount itself, as well as any penalties, fines, charges, or late payment interest) related to your activities on the Platform, where applicable;</li>
    <li>we may also seek to verify the legitimacy of any payments we received from other relevant users;</li>
    <li>if, in our reasonable opinion, we believe such payments are not legitimate (including, for example, payments made by the unauthorised use of a credit card), then we can retain and deal with such payments in our own discretion; and</li>
    <li>the relevant transaction under which the illegitimate payment was received by us will be deemed to be void, and we will not be required to make any payment to you as a result (but may, in our discretion, make a payment to you equal to the whole or part of the amount which would have otherwise been due to you, depending on how we deal with the illegitimate payment).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the avoidance of doubt, payments in exchange of credits earned through rewards will be processed separately from refunds of unused credits purchased.</p>

    <p>We aim to process all refunds within 5 business days of the date of receipt of the notice, and all request for payments within 10 business days of the date of receipt of the request. If it takes longer, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
