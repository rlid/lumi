    <h3>What is LumiAsk?</h3>
    <p>LumiAsk started as a tool that helps you track and gain traction on the questions you ask in online communities.
        If you are not having much luck with your post or comment on Reddit, your message on Discord, or other social
        media platforms, you are welcome to try LumiAsk and see how much further some extra incentive will take you.</p>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Does it really work?</h3>
    <p>You should probably always start with a simpler way, e.g. a Google search, asking friends or an online community,
        and there is no reason to use this platform if you can get the answer more easily. But there are times when your
        question is so specific that no one else seems to care without extra incentive, and you want something that
        reaches a little deeper than your own social circle, or go beyond the active users of a community.</p>
