    <h3>What is LumiAsk?</h3>
    <p>LumiAsk started as a tool that helps you track and gain traction on the questions you ask in online communities.
        If you are not having much luck with your post or comment on Reddit, your message on Discord, or other social
        media platforms, you are welcome to try LumiAsk and see how much further some extra incentive will take you.</p>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <h6>If you are posting as an asker...</h6>
    <ol>
        <li>Set a topic (e.g. something you are interested in) and set a reward
        </li>
        <li>Chat with anyone interested to help you and provide clarifications if needed</li>
        <li><strong>Accept any request for engagement</strong> when you are ready, remember to check the answerer's
            credentials if necessary
        </li>
        <li>Ask your question and <strong>rate the engagement</strong> when an answer is provided</li>
    </ol>

    <h6>If you want to help with an existing post...</h6>
    <ol>
        <li>Chat with the OP for any clarifications needed</li>
        <li><strong>Request for engagement</strong> when you are ready, or <strong>share</strong> the post with anyone
            who might be able to help
        </li>
        <li>After the request is accepted, help the OP and <strong>rate the engagement</strong> when you are done
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h6>(New!) If you are posting as an answerer...</h6>
    <ol>
        <li>Set a topic (something you are knowledgeable about) and set a reward
        </li>
        <li>Chat with anyone interested in the topic and provide clarifications if needed</li>
        <li><strong>Accept any request for engagement</strong> when you are ready
        </li>
        <li>Answer the questions and rate the engagement when you are done</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If both parties rate the engagement as successful, a reward will be distributed from the asker to the answerer
        and all referrers leading to the successful engagement.</p>

    <h3>What can I post?</h3>
    <p></p>

    <h3>When is payment taken?</h3>
    <p>Payment is not required at the time of posting.</p>
    <p>As the asker, before you can accept an engagement from a prospective answerer or request for engagement on an
        answerer's post, your balance will be checked and a top-up will be required if your balance is not enough for
        the reward.</p>
    <p>Once an engagement is entered into, an amount equal to the total reward is reserved in the seller's account. If
        the engagement is successful, the reserved amount will be distributed to the participants involved. Otherwise,
        the reserved amount will be released back to the asker's account.</p>

    <h3>What if I receive multiple requests for engagements on the same post?</h3>
    <p>You can accept multiple active engagements at the same time, e.g. you want to hear from different perspectives /
        a second opinion to cross-check the answers, but as an asker you should be prepared to pay the reward for each
        successful engagement when you accept.</p>
    <p>If you only need 1 person to help you, feel free to pick the most suitable one based on your criteria and ignore
        the others.</p>

    <h3>What is private mode?</h3>
    <p>If you post in private mode, your post will not be listed publicly on the platform, and it can only be accessed
        with a link from you or the referrers. <strong>This feature relies on you to send the link to your friends or
            share it on social media to kick off the chain reaction.</strong></p>
    <p>With private mode, we hope that we can offer extra incentives for referrers to spread the word without worrying
        about potential abuses of the system.</p>
    <p>At the same time, you probably won't lose much by hiding the post on our platform, if that means more visibility
        on high-traffic online communities / social media.</p>

    <h3>How much can I earn from referrals?</h3>
    <p>In public mode, you can earn up to 10% of the post reward set by the OP, if your referral leads to a successful
        engagement directly. You can still earn a smaller reward if your participation is in a chain of referrals that
        leads to a successful engagement.
    </p>
    <p>In private mode, it can be as much as 40% of the post reward set by the OP.</p>

    <h3>How are the rewards distributed?</h3>
    <p>Following a successful engagement, the reward is distributed to all participants in the chain leading to the
        successful engagement.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>In public mode:</p>
            <p>The total referral reward is capped at 20% of the post reward set by the OP.
            </p>
            <p>The last referrer (who directly introduced the answerer) gets half of the total referral reward (i.e.
                10%), and each earlier referrer gets half of the remaining referral reward (e.g. the second last
                referrer gets 5%, the third last referrer gets 2.5%, and so on).</p>
            <p>The answerer gets all the remaining reward after a platform fee of 10%, i.e. between 90% (no referrers)
                and ~70% of the post reward.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In private mode:</p>
            <p>The total referral reward is capped at 40% of the post reward set by the OP.
            </p>
            <p>Each referrer sets their own share of the referral reward to claim, the default being half of the
                remaining referral reward, e.g. the first referrer (closest to the OP) in a chain gets 20% by default.
            </p>
            <p>The answerer gets all the remaining reward after a platform fee of 10%, i.e. between 90% (no referrers)
                and ~50% of the post reward.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Does it really work?</h3>
    <p>You should probably always start with a simpler way, e.g. a Google search, asking friends or an online community,
        and there is no reason to use this platform if you can get the answer more easily. But there are times when your
        question is so specific that no one else seems to care without extra incentive, and you want something that
        reaches a little deeper than your own social circle, or go beyond the active users of a community.</p>
