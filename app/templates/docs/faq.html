                    <p>We are constantly exploring new ideas to promote responsible behavior, maintain and improve the
                        quality user-generated contents, and help users to assess the trustworthiness of others. Our
                        current recommendations are as follows:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Ask questions that you will know if an answer is satisfactory when given, e.g. because the
                            answer can be verified by yourself once enough proof is presented by the answerer (e.g. you
                            ask for a coupon code and the one given by the answerer works), or because the answerer
                            convinced you of their credentials through proof (e.g. you want to know about a university
                            and the answerer showed you his ID with sensitive information redacted), or because you are
                            prepared to enter into multiple engagements to cross-check the answers.
                        </li>
                        <li>Make sure to check out the other user's track record of past engagements before entering
                            into an engagement. While it does not prevent someone from giving poor answers, the need to
                            maintain a good track record should deter people from entering into engagements
                            opportunistically.
                        </li>
                        <li>(Coming soon) Please consider <strong>tipping</strong> particularly helpful answerers as a
                            way to encourage answerers to respond with high quality answers.
                        </li>
                        <li>Each user has a reward limit and they cannot participate in any posts with a reward higher
                            than their reward limit. The limit is reduced aggressively for users on a bad run of
                            engagements, and you will be warned if their limit is reduced after they entered into
                            engagement with you.
                        </li>
                        <li>In addition to rating the engagement, please report to us particularly poor interactions or
                            deliberate misinformation.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Please remember that like any platform powered by user‚Äêgenerated contents, you are ultimately
                        responsible for verifying the information provided to you and deciding whether to rely on it.
                        You should always exercise caution when interacting with strangers on the internet and be wary
                        of proof. You are encouraged to ask for more proof if you find what is provided to you is
                        insufficient.</p>
                    <p>Developing effective strategies to maintain and improve the quality of user-generated contents
                        and holding the sources accountable is one of the main motivations for us to create the
                        platform, and it will always remain an area of active research and development for us. We would

                    <p>Up to 40% of the post reward set by the OP can be claimed by the referrers in private mode. The
                        default is 20% (half of the maximum) under the assumption that you want to earn a nice reward
                        while leaving something on the table, so it is still attractive for the next person to
                        participate.</p>
                    <p>You can choose a different portion, e.g. 0% if you are a good friend or just want to help the OP
                        out of kindness, or all of the 40% if you plan to put in a lot of effort to help the OP, or
                        somewhere in-between.</p>
                    <p>Remember that the more you claim from the total reward, the less attractive it will be for other
                        people to participate from your point of referral, and the less likely it will lead to a
                        successful engagement (unless you are confident you can find the right person yourself).</p>

                        <li>For potential disputes in grey area, consider the value of reward lost vs. the likelihood of
                            damage to your reputation. If necessary, you could protect your reputation by rating the
                            engagement as successful when you are the asker / unsuccessful when you are the answerer.
                            This is mostly relevant for new users who do not have a track record yet.

                    <p>You should probably always start with a more conventional way, e.g. a Google search, asking
                        friends or an online community, and there is no reason to use this platform if you can get the
                        answer more easily. But there are times when your question is so specific that no one seems to
                        care without extra incentive, and you want something that reaches a little deeper than your own
                        social circle, and go beyond the active users of a
                        community.</p>
                    <p>In any case, we believe that LumiAsk has its place as a tool for finding specific knowledge, and
                        it should be an option for everyone to consider when the results from more conventional methods
                        are less than satisfactory.</p>
