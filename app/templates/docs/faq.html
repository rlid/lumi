    <h1>General</h1>
    <h3 id="qWhat">What is LumiAsk?</h3>
    <p>LumiAsk started as a tool that helps you track and gain traction on the questions you ask in online communities.
        If you are not having much luck with your message on a Discord server, or your post / comment on Reddit or other
        social media platforms, you are welcome to give LumiAsk a go and see how much further some extra incentive will
        take you.</p>


    <h3 id="qHow">How does it work?</h3>
    <h5>If you have a question to ask...</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Set a topic (e.g. something you are interested in) and set a reward to participants involved in getting
            your question successfully answered
        </li>
        <li>Chat with anyone interested to help you and provide clarifications if needed</li>
        <li><strong>Accept a request for engagement</strong> when you are ready, remember to check the answerer's
            credentials if necessary
        </li>
        <li>Ask your question and <strong>rate the engagement</strong> after an answer is provided</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>If you want to help with an existing post...</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Chat with the OP (Original Poster) for any clarifications needed</li>
        <li><strong>Request for engagement</strong> when you are ready, or <strong>share</strong> the post with anyone
            who might be able to help. If you are sharing, <u>make sure to use your unique referrer link using the
                "Share" button</u>
        </li>
        <li>After the request is accepted, help the OP and <strong>rate the engagement</strong> when you are done
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h5>(New!) If you are posting as an answerer...</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Set a topic (something you are knowledgeable about) and set a reward that you want to receive after
            successfully answering a question
        </li>
        <li>Chat with anyone interested in the topic and provide clarifications if needed</li>
        <li><strong>Accept any request for engagement</strong> when you are ready
        </li>
        <li>Answer the questions and rate the engagement when you are done</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If both the asker and the answerer rate the engagement as successful, a reward will be distributed from the asker
        to the answerer and all referrers leading to the successful engagement.</p>


    <h1>Posting</h1>
    <h3 id="qPrivateMode">What is private mode?</h3>
    <p>If you post in private mode, your post will not be listed publicly on the platform, and it can only be accessed
        with a link from you or the referrers. <strong>This feature relies on you to send the link to your friends or
            an online community to kick off the process.</strong></p>
    <p>With private mode, we hope that we can offer extra incentives for referrers to spread the word without worrying
        about not getting recognised when rewards are distributed.</p>
    <p>You should use private mode if your question is easily answered by the right person (e.g. if you are looking for
        someone to share a specific experience), but might require a search beyond your immediate network of friends and
        active members of online communities.</p>


    <h3 id="qAfterSubmission">What happens after my post is submitted?</h3>
    <p>In public mode, you can just wait for other users to take interest in your post and contact you or refer your
        post. We also use our own channels to connect you with someone to help you. You can also ask your friends to
        spread the word.</p>
    <p>In private mode, nothing happens until you kick off the process by sending a link to the post to a Discord
        server, post it on Reddit or other social media platforms.</p>


    <h3 id="qRewardDisplay">Why do my friends see a different reward from what I set for my post?</h3>
    <p>The reward displayed is dependent on the viewer. When another user views your post, they will see how much they
        would receive / pay on posts where you are the asker / answerer. If they are viewing your post through a
        referrer's link, the referrer's reward will be taken into account.</p>
    <p>For example, if you offer $5 on a question you are asking, other viewers will see $4.5 as the reward because that
        is the amount they would receive by answering the question, after the platform fee. If a user sends the post to
        a friend using a referral link, their friend would see $4 as the reward after the platform fee and the
        referrer's reward.</p>
    <p>If you are logged in, you should always see the rewards you set on your posts.</p>


    <h1>Referrals</h1>
    <h3 id="qReferrerReward">How much can I earn from referrals?</h3>
    <p>In public mode, you can earn up to 10% of the post reward set by the OP, if your referral leads to a successful
        engagement directly. You can still earn a smaller reward if your participation is in a chain of referrals that
        leads to a successful engagement.
    </p>
    <p>In private mode, it can be as much as 40% of the post reward set by the OP.</p>

    <h3 id="qHowToRefer">How do I refer someone?</h3>
    <p>Make sure you use the "Share" button to generate your own referrer's link and share it. Simply sending a link to
        the post will not properly register your involvement in the referral process.</p>


    <h3 id="qReferralClaim">How much referrer's reward should I claim in private mode?</h3>
    <p>Up to 40% of the reward set by the OP can be claimed by the referrers in private mode. The default is 20% (half
        of the maximum) under the assumption that you want to earn a nice reward while leaving something on the table,
        so it is still attractive for the next person to participate.</p>
    <p>You can choose a different portion, e.g. 0% if you are a good friend and just want to help out of
        kindness, or all of the 40% if you plan to put in a lot of effort to help the OP, or somewhere in-between.</p>
    <p>Remember that the more you claim from the total reward, the less attractive it will be for other people to
        participate from your point of referral, and the less likely it will lead to a successful engagement (unless you
        are confident you can find the right person yourself).</p>



    <h1>Engagements</h1>
    <h3 id="qMultipleEngagements">What if I receive multiple requests for engagements on the same post?</h3>
    <p>You can accept multiple active engagements at the same time, e.g. you want to hear from different perspectives /
        a second opinion to cross-check the answers, but as an asker you should be prepared to pay the reward for each
        successful engagement when you accept.</p>
    <p>If you only need one person to help you, feel free to pick the most suitable one based on your own criteria and
        ignore the others.</p>

    <h3 id="qCancel">Can I cancel an engagement?</h3>
    <p>You can cancel your request for engagement before it is accepted by the OP by clicking the "Cancel" button.</p>
    <p>If the engagement is accepted but an answer has not been provided, you should let the other user know as soon
        as possible about your intention to cancel and rate the engagement as unsuccessful.</p>


    <h3 id="qNegativeRating">The engagement is not going anywhere, what should I do?</h3>
    <p>If you or the user at the other end of the engagement realised that the engagement is unlikely to be a success,
        after entering into an engagement (e.g. due to a misunderstanding), you should politely let the other user know
        (hopefully they have realised the same) and rate the engagement as unsuccessful.</p>
    <p>It is perfectly OK to rate an engagement as unsuccessful as long as it is genuine - if both users agree that the
        engagement is not successful, it will not have any negative impact on either user, as long as they act honestly
        and courteously towards each other.</p>


    <h3 id="qAskTooMany">The asker is asking more questions than I expected - what should I do?</h3>
    <p>If you feel that the asker is asking more questions than what you understood before entering into the engagement,
        you should politely explain that it is taking longer than expected, and ask them to clarify how many more
        question they have in mind, and depending on their answer, either answer the remaining questions or agree to
        rate the engagement based on the interactions so far and open a new engagement.</p>
    <p>In any case, you should feel free to rate your engagement as successful, as long as you are acting honestly and
        answered all the questions that was in scope originally.</p>


    <h3 id="qDispute">What happens if an engagement is rated differently by the asker and the answerer?</h3>
    <p>An engagement can be rated as successful(&plus;) or unsuccessful(&minus;) by the asker and the answerer. No
        reward is distributed if there is any discrepancy in the asker and answerer's rating of the engagement.</p>
    <p>A <strong>dispute</strong> arises if the asker rates &minus; and the answerer rates &plus;, the party with a
        weaker trustworthiness on the platform will have its trustworthiness negatively impacted</p>
    <p>There will be no dispute as long as the answerer rates the engagement as &minus;, in which case the
        trustworthiness of neither party will be directly impacted</p>


    <h3 id="qAnswererProtection">If an asker can always rate negatively to avoid paying, do I have any protection as the
        answerer?</h3>
    <p>If a buyer does not pay a reward by giving a negative rating untruthfully, their trustworthiness will be
        aggressively reduced very quickly, and they will lose the ability to make new post or enter into
        engagements.</p>
    <p>All the information about past engagements are available on a user's public profile, so if you are not
        comfortable with the user's track record, you can choose not to engage with such user even before their account
        becomes restricted due to a low trustworthiness score.</p>


    <h3 id="qPayment">When is payment taken?</h3>
    <p>Payment is not required at the time of posting.</p>
    <p>As the asker, before you can accept an engagement from a prospective answerer or request for engagement on an
        answerer's post, your balance will be checked and a top-up will be required if your balance is not enough for
        the reward.</p>
    <p>Once an engagement is entered into, an amount equal to the total reward is reserved in the seller's account. If
        the engagement is rated as successful by both the asker and the answerer, the reserved amount will be
        distributed to the participants involved. Otherwise, the reserved amount will be released back to the asker's
        account.</p>


    <h3 id="qAnswerQuality">How do you ensure the quality of the answers provided?</h3>
    <p>We are constantly releasing new features for the purpose of promoting responsible behavior, maintaining and
        improving the quality user-generated contents, and helping users to assess the trustworthiness of others.
        Our current recommendations are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ask questions that you will know if an answer is satisfactory when given, e.g. because the answer can be
            verified by yourself once enough proof is presented by the answerer (e.g. you ask for a coupon code and the
            one given by the answerer works), or because the answerer convinced you of their credentials through proof
            (e.g. you want to know about a university and the answerer showed you his ID with sensitive information
            redacted), or because you are prepared to enter into multiple engagements to cross-check the answers.
        </li>
        <li>Make sure to check out the other user's track record of past engagements before entering into an engagement.
            While this does not prevent someone from giving poor answers, it should deter people from entering into
            engagements when they are not sure if they can help.
        </li>
        <li>There is a limit on the reward of posts a user can participate in, which is reduced aggressively for users
            on a bad run of engagements. Such users cannot participate in high reward posts, and you will be warned if
            their limit is reduced after they entered into engagement with you.
        </li>
        <li>In addition to rating the engagement, please report to us particularly poor interactions or deliberate
            misinformation.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Please remember that like any platform powered by user‐generated contents, you are ultimately
        responsible for verifying the information provided to you and deciding whether to rely on it.</p>
    <p>Developing effective strategies to maintain and improve the quality of user-generated contents and holding the
        sources accountable is one of the main motivations for us to create the platform, and it will always remain an
        area of active research and development for us. We would like to work very closely with our users, so if you
        have any ideas please get in touch!</p>


    <h3 id="qRewardDistribution">How are the rewards distributed?</h3>
    <p>Following a successful engagement, the reward is distributed to all participants in the chain leading to the
        successful engagement.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>In public mode:</p>
            <p>The total referral reward is capped at 20% of the post reward set by the OP.
            </p>
            <p>The last referrer (who directly introduced the answerer) gets half of the total referral reward (i.e.
                10%), and each earlier referrer gets half of the remaining referral reward (e.g. the second last
                referrer gets 5%, the third last referrer gets 2.5%, and so on).</p>
            <p>The answerer gets all the remaining reward after a platform fee of 10%, i.e. between 90% (no referrers)
                and ~70% of the post reward.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In private mode:</p>
            <p>The total referral reward is capped at 40% of the post reward set by the OP.
            </p>
            <p>Each referrer sets their own share of the referral reward to claim, the default being half of the
                remaining referral reward, e.g. the first referrer (closest to the OP) in a chain gets 20% by default.
            </p>
            <p>The answerer gets all the remaining reward after a platform fee of 10%, i.e. between 90% (no referrers)
                and ~50% of the post reward.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h3 id="qDoesItWork">Does it really work?</h3>
    <p>You should probably always start with a simpler way, e.g. a Google search, asking friends or an online community,
        and there is no reason to use this platform if you can get the answer more easily. But there are times when your
        question is so specific that no one else seems to care without extra incentive, and you want something that
        reaches a little deeper than your own social circle, or go beyond the active users of a community.</p>
