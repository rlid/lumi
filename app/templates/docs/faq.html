    <h1>General</h1>
    <h3 id="qWhat">What is LumiAsk?</h3>
    <p>LumiAsk started as a tool that helps you track and gain traction on the questions you ask in online communities.
        If you are not having much luck with your message on a Discord server, or your post / comment on Reddit or other
        social media platforms, you are welcome to give LumiAsk a go and see how much further some extra incentive will
        take you.</p>


    <h3 id="qHow">How does it work?</h3>
    <h5>If you have a question to ask...</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Make a post - set a topic (e.g. something you are interested in) and set a reward for getting your questions
            successfully answered
        </li>
        <li>Chat with anyone interested to help you and provide clarifications if needed</li>
        <li><strong>Accept a request for engagement</strong> when you are ready
        </li>
        <li>Ask your question and <strong>rate the engagement</strong> after an answer is provided</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>If you want to help with an existing post...</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Chat with the OP (Original Poster) for any clarifications needed</li>
        <li><strong>Request for engagement</strong> when you are ready, or <strong>share</strong> the post with anyone
            who might be able to help. If you are sharing, <u>make sure to use the "Share" button to generate your
                unique referrer's link</u>
        </li>
        <li>After the request is accepted, answer the OP's questions and <strong>rate the engagement</strong> when you
            are done
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h5>(New!) If you are posting as an answerer...</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Set a topic (something you are knowledgeable about) and set a reward that you want to receive after
            successfully answering a question
        </li>
        <li>Chat with anyone interested in the topic and provide clarifications if needed</li>
        <li><strong>Accept a request for engagement</strong> when you are ready
        </li>
        <li>Answer the questions and rate the engagement when you are done</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If both the asker and the answerer rate the engagement as successful, a reward will be distributed from the asker
        to the answerer and all referrers leading to the successful engagement.</p>


    <h3 id="qPayment">When is payment taken?</h3>
    <p>Payment is not required at the time of posting.</p>
    <p>As the asker, before you can accept an engagement from a prospective answerer or request for engagement on an
        answerer's post, your balance will be checked and a top-up will be required if your balance is not enough for
        the reward.</p>
    <p>Once an engagement is entered into, an amount equal to the total reward will be reserved in the seller's account.
        If the engagement is rated as successful by both the asker and the answerer, the reserved amount will be
        distributed to the participants involved. Otherwise, the reserved amount will be released back to the asker's
        account.</p>


    <h1>Posting</h1>
    <h3 id="qPrivateMode">What is private mode?</h3>
    <p>If you post in private mode, your post will not be listed publicly on the platform, and it can only be accessed
        with a link from you or the referrers. <strong>This feature relies on you to send the link to your friends or
            an online community to kick off the process.</strong></p>
    <p>With private mode, we hope that we can offer extra incentives for referrers to spread the word without worrying
        about not getting recognised when rewards are distributed.</p>
    <p>You should use private mode if your question is easily answered by the right person (e.g. if you are looking for
        someone to share a specific experience), but requires more effort to search beyond your immediate network of
        friends and active members of online communities.</p>


    <h3 id="qAfterSubmission">What happens after my post is submitted?</h3>
    <p>In public mode, you can just wait for other users to take interest in your post and contact you or share your
        post with others. We also use our own channels to connect you with someone to help you. You can also ask your
        friends to spread the word.</p>
    <p>In private mode, nothing happens until you kick off the process by sending a link to the post to a Discord
        server, post it on Reddit or other social media platforms.</p>


    <h3 id="qRewardDisplay">Why do others see a different reward from what I set for my post?</h3>
    <p>The reward displayed is dependent on the viewer. When another user views your post, they see how much they would
        receive by answering your question, or how much they would pay if you answer their question, depending on the
        type of your post. If they are viewing your post through a referrer's link, the referrer's reward will be taken
        into account.</p>
    <p>As an example, if you make a post to <strong>ask</strong> questions and you offer $5, other viewers will see $4.5
        as the reward because that is the amount they would receive by answering the question, after the platform fee.
        If another user sends the post to a friend using a referral link, their friend would see $4 as the reward after
        the platform fee and the referrer's reward.</p>
    <p>As another example, if you make a post to <strong>answer</strong> questions and you want $5 as reward, other
        viewers will see $5.5 as the amount to pay because that is the amount they would be paying, after the platform
        fee. If another user sends the post to a friend using a referral link, their friend would see $6 as the amount
        to pay after the platform fee and the referrer's reward.</p>
    <p>See <a href="#qRewardDistribution">How are the rewards distributed?</a> for a more detailed breakdown of the
        rewards.
    </p>
    <p>If you are logged in, you should always see the rewards you set on your posts.</p>


    <h1>Referrals</h1>
    <h3 id="qReferrerReward">How much can I earn from referrals?</h3>
    <p>In public mode, you can earn up to 10% of the post reward set by the OP, if your referral leads to a successful
        engagement directly, i.e. you introduced the person who successfully engaged with the OP. You can still earn a
        (smaller) reward if you are involved in the chain of referrals that leads to a successful engagement.
    </p>
    <p>In private mode, it can be as much as 40% of the post reward set by the OP.</p>

    <h3 id="qHowToRefer">How do I refer someone?</h3>
    <p>Make sure you use the "Share" button to generate your own referrer's link and share it. Simply sending a link to
        the post will not properly register your involvement in the referral process.</p>


    <h3 id="qReferralClaim">How much referrer's reward should I claim in private mode?</h3>
    <p>Up to 40% of the post reward set by the OP can be claimed by the referrers in private mode. The default is 20%
        (half of the maximum) under the assumption that you want to earn a nice reward while leaving something on the
        table, so it is still attractive for the next person to participate.</p>
    <p>You can choose a different portion, e.g. 0% if you are a good friend or just want to help the OP out of
        kindness, or all of the 40% if you plan to put in a lot of effort to help the OP, or somewhere in-between.</p>
    <p>Remember that the more you claim from the total reward, the less attractive it will be for other people to
        participate from your point of referral, and the less likely it will lead to a successful engagement (unless you
        are confident you can find the right person yourself).</p>



    <h1>Engagements</h1>
    <h3 id="qMultipleEngagements">What if I receive multiple requests for engagements?</h3>
    <p>You can have multiple active engagements at the same time, e.g. you want to hear from different perspectives,
        or you need a second opinion to cross-check the answers, but as an asker you should be prepared to pay the
        reward for each successful engagement when you accept.</p>
    <p>If you only need one person to help you, feel free to pick the most promising one based on your own criteria and
        ignore the others.</p>


    <h3 id="qCancel">Can I cancel an engagement?</h3>
    <p>You can cancel your request for engagement before it is accepted by the OP by clicking the "Cancel" button.</p>
    <p>If the engagement is accepted but an answer has not been provided, you should let the other user know as soon
        as possible about your intention to cancel and rate the engagement as unsuccessful.</p>


    <h3 id="qNegativeRating">The engagement is not going anywhere, what should I do?</h3>
    <p>If you or the other user realise that the engagement is unlikely to be successful after entering it is entered
        into, perhaps due to a misunderstanding, you should politely let the other user know (and explain if they have
        not realised the same) and rate the engagement as unsuccessful.</p>
    <p>It is perfectly OK to rate an engagement as unsuccessful as long as it is genuine - if both users agree that the
        engagement will not be successful, it will not have any negative impact on either user, as long as they act
        honestly and courteously towards each other.</p>


    <h3 id="qAskTooMany">The asker is asking more questions than I expected - what should I do?</h3>
    <p>If you feel that the asker is asking more questions than what you understood before entering into the engagement,
        you should politely explain that it is taking longer than expected, and ask them to clarify how many more
        question they have, and depending on their answer, either answer the remaining questions or try to reach an
        agreement to rate the engagement based on the interactions so far and open a new engagement.</p>
    <p>In any case, you should feel free to rate your engagement as successful, as long as you honestly believe that you
        have answered what you originally agreed to.</p>


    <h3 id="qRatingDiscrepancy">What if I disagree with the other user's rating?</h3>
    <p>An engagement can be rated as successful(&plus;) or unsuccessful(&minus;) by the asker and the answerer. No
        reward is distributed if there is any discrepancy in the asker and answerer's rating of the engagement.</p>
    <p>A <a href="#qDispute">dispute</a> arises if the asker rates "&minus;" and the answerer rates "&plus;", and the
        user with a "worse" reputation will have its reputation negatively impacted.</p>
    <p>There will be no dispute as long as the asker rates the engagement as "&plus;", or the answerer rates the
        engagement as "&minus;", in which case the reputation of neither party will be impacted.</p>



    <h1>Rewards</h1>

    <h3 id="qRewardDistribution">How are the rewards distributed?</h3>
    <p>Following a successful engagement, the reward is distributed to all participants in the chain leading to the
        successful engagement.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>In public mode:</p>
            <p>The total referral reward is capped at 20% of the post reward set by the OP.
            </p>
            <p>The last referrer (closest to the person who successfully engaged with the OP) gets half of the total
                referral reward (i.e. 10%), and each prior referrer gets half of the remaining referral reward (e.g. the
                second last referrer gets 5%, the third last referrer gets 2.5%, and so on).</p>
            <p>The answerer gets all the remaining reward after a platform fee of 10%, i.e. between 90% (no referrers)
                and ~70% (~77% for an answerer's post) of the total reward.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In private mode:</p>
            <p>The total referral reward is capped at 40% of the post reward set by the OP.
            </p>
            <p>Each referrer sets their own share of the referral reward to claim, the default being half of the
                remaining referral reward, e.g. the first referrer (closest to the OP) gets 20% by default, the second
                referrer gets 10%, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>The answerer gets all the remaining reward after a platform fee of 10%, i.e. between 90% (no referrers)
                and ~50% (~67% for an answerer's post) of the total reward.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that because the OP always sets the reward he wants to pay or receive, platform fees and referral rewards
        are deducted from the reward set by the OP when they are the asker, and added when they are the answerer.</p>



    <h1>Disputes</h1>

    <h3 id="qDispute">What is a dispute?</h3>
    <p>A dispute arises if the asker rates the engagement as unsuccessful (&minus;) and the answerer rates it as
        successful (&plus;).</p>


    <h3 id="qDisputeResolution">What happens after a dispute?</h3>
    <p>When a dispute arises, the user with a "worse" reputation will have its reputation negatively impacted, and their
        reward limit (the maximum reward of posts they can participate in) reduced.</p>
    <p>This process does not determine whether rewards should be paid out by the asker - it is determined by the asker
        alone, regardless the outcome of the dispute resolution. However, the asker's ability to post new questions or
        enter into engagements will be restricted.</p>


    <h3 id="qAnswererProtection">If the asker can always rate negatively to avoid paying out rewards, do I have any
        protection as the answerer?</h3>
    <p>If an asker consistently gives false ratings to avoid paying out rewards, their reputation will be
        aggressively reduced, and they will lose the ability to make new post or enter into engagements. For a new user,
        it only takes one dispute to reduce their reward limit to $1, and two disputes to disable their account
        completely.</p>
    <p>Even before their accounts are restricted due to low reputation, you can check out a user's track record and if
        it does not look promising, you should think twice before entering into an engagement.</p>



    <h1>Reputation</h1>
    <h3 id="qReputation">How do I protect my reputation?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>First and foremost, the best way to protect your reputation is to act courteously and honestly towards each
            other. After all, your reputation is reflected through your actions.
        </li>
        <li>Always check the other user's track record before requesting for or accepting an engagement. By requesting
            for or accepting an engagement, you are putting your reputation on the line because you are giving the other
            user the permission to influence it by rating the engagement with you.
        </li>
        <li>Don't be afraid to rate an engagement differently from the other user if it is your honest assessment. You
            are helping the community by providing your honest feedback on the other user, and you are very likely to
            win in the automatic dispute resolution if you have always acted responsibly. As long as you are not
            consistently getting into disputes with other users, there is no need to worry about reputational damage.
        </li>
        <li>For potential disputes in grey area, consider the value of reward lost vs. the likelihood of damage to your
            reputation. If necessary, you could protect your reputation by rating the engagement as successful when you
            are the asker / unsuccessful when you are the answerer. This is mostly relevant for new users who do not
            have a track record yet.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h3 id="qAnswerQuality">How do you ensure the quality of the answers provided?</h3>
    <p>We are constantly releasing new features for the purpose of promoting responsible behavior, maintaining and
        improving the quality user-generated contents, and helping users to assess the trustworthiness of others.
        Our current recommendations are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ask questions that you will know if an answer is satisfactory when given, e.g. because the answer can be
            verified by yourself once enough proof is presented by the answerer (e.g. you ask for a coupon code and the
            one given by the answerer works), or because the answerer convinced you of their credentials through proof
            (e.g. you want to know about a university and the answerer showed you his ID with sensitive information
            redacted), or because you are prepared to enter into multiple engagements to cross-check the answers.
        </li>
        <li>Make sure to check out the other user's track record of past engagements before entering into an engagement.
            While it does not prevent someone from giving poor answers, the need to maintain a good track record
            should deter people from entering into engagements opportunistically.
        </li>
        <li>There is a limit on the reward of posts a user can participate in, which is reduced aggressively for users
            on a bad run of engagements. Such users cannot participate in high reward posts, and you will be warned if
            their limit is reduced after they entered into engagement with you.
        </li>
        <li>In addition to rating the engagement, please report to us particularly poor interactions or deliberate
            misinformation.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Please remember that like any platform powered by user‐generated contents, you are ultimately
        responsible for verifying the information provided to you and deciding whether to rely on it.</p>
    <p>Developing effective strategies to maintain and improve the quality of user-generated contents and holding the
        sources accountable is one of the main motivations for us to create the platform, and it will always remain an
        area of active research and development for us. We would like to work very closely with our users, so if you
        have any ideas please get in touch!</p>



    <h3 id="qDoesItWork">Does it really work?</h3>
    <p>You should probably always start with a simpler way, e.g. a Google search, asking friends or an online community,
        and there is no reason to use this platform if you can get the answer more easily. But there are times when your
        question is so specific that no one else seems to care without extra incentive, and you want something that
        reaches a little deeper than your own social circle, or go beyond the active users of a community.</p>


    <h3 id="qNewQuestion">How to ask a question that is not answered here?</h3>
