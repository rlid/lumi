            <p class="lead">Everyone has specific knowledge or experience that others may find valuable, yet they are
                not always easy to find with a search or helpfully discussed in online communities.</p>
            <p class="lead">We make them easier to discover and rewarding to share.</p>

            <p class="lead">How it works -
            <ol class="lead">
                <li>create your tip jar link and share on your online profiles</li>
                <li>others click the link to send you a message and a "tip"</li>
                <li>you claim the tip by responding to the message</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p class="lead">If you match any of the following descriptions:</p>
            <ul class="lead">
                <li>you occasionally (or regularly) post or comment in online communities</li>
                <li>you have written reviews on Amazon, Google or other review websites</li>
                <li>you have a profile set up on LinkedIn, Facebook or other social media</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="lead">
                then you are already discoverable as a "casual" content creator, and you are uniquely positioned to
                share your specific knowledge and experience on-demand.
            </p>
            <a href="{{ url_for('main.browse') }}" class="btn btn-success btn-lg mb-5">Generate your "tip jar" link</a>
        </div>
    </main>
