            <ul class="small">
                <li>Ask questions that you will know when an answer is satisfactory, e.g. because the answerer
                    convinced you of their credential through a <a href="#">timestamp</a>, or because the correctness
                    of the answer can be verified by yourself, once enough proof is presented</li>
                <li>Be specific, give criteria on who you want to hear from if possible</li>
                <li>Use <b>hashtags</b> so the relevant people can find your post quicker, e.g. if your question is
                    about New York, put #NewYork somewhere in the Details section for it to be recognized as a hashtag
                </li>
                <li>Spread the word and share your post using social media and other online communities, but <b>please
                    follow their rules and don't spam</b>. Generally, a good way is to ask the same question in the
                    community and offer to pay a reward using the link to your post here</li>
                <li>Don't put any personal information in the post</li>
                <li>Enable Social Media mode to offer even more incentive for people to spread the word by guaranteeing
                    a referral reward</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="card-title text-muted">Payments and rewards</h5>
            <ul class="small">
                <li>Payment is not required when a post is created</li>
                <li>If someone takes an interest in your post and makes an engagement request, the buyer's account
                    balance will be checked before the engagement can be entered into, and a top-up will
                    be required if there is not enough funds to make a payment for the reward offered</li>
                <li>If both parties rate the engagement as successful(+), a reward will be distributed according to
                    the <a href="#">reward distribution rules</a></li>
                <li>If the buyer rates the engagement as unsuccessful(-), no reward will be distributed and the reserved
                    amount will be released back to the buyer's account</li>
                <li>The <b>track record</b> of each user is available for all users to see on the user profile page, it
                    is also used model a user's <b>trustworthiness on the platform</b> which limits the reward value of
                    posts the user is allowed to participate in</li>
