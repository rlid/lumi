A user post a question / request, you name a reward for a satisfactory response

Other users contribute in 3 ways:
 - giving comments / suggestions
 - bringing the question to someone elseâ€™s attention
 - request to engage with the OP

By accepting the request, the engagement will be open until 24 hours after either party rated the engagement as successful / unsuccessful. The other user will be able to rate in the last 24-hr window, not rated is regarded as unsuccessful after the deadline.

Reward will be released only if the initiator rated the engagement as successful.

In the event that the initiator rated unsuccessful and the responder rated successful, a dispute will be recorded. The dispute will impact the creditability of the party with a weaker credibility.

No other rating scenarios will impact the credibility of either user, regardless of whether a reward is demanded (responder rated successful) / given (initiator rated successful).
