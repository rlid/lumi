- Set price for question
- Asking too many questions (share stats on credibility, average price paid, average number of exchanges, average time to finish)
- Make sure referers are compensated
- Set maximum price allowed
- Measures to check proof/credentials (ideally anonymously) before engagement
- How to close out if asker or answerer does not rate the engagement
