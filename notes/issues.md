- Set price for question
- Asking too many questions (share stats on credibility, average price paid, average number of exchanges, average time to finish)
- Make sure referers are compensated
- Set maximum price allowed
- Measures to check proof/credentials (ideally anonymously) before engagement
- How to close out if asker or answerer does not rate the engagement

### Cheating
- same reward whether the service is given directly or through a referral, only the distribution of referral fee is different, either to the referral chain or shared among contributors with highest credibility
- registration is not free, user buys account with initial balance, can only withdraw balance reaches a threshold
- User creates a referral chain using multiple accounts, the reward decreases exponentially to reduce the incentive
