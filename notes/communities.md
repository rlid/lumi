Problems with online communities
 - Community interest over individual interest
 - High expectations from existing members, they expect you to do your own research / search existing posts before posting
 - User incentives not aligned
 - Hostile to new users
 - Culture
 - Toxic users/comments
 - Gets complicated over time
 - Too passionate / zealous 
 - Addiction

Problem with search engines
- most informative / highest ranked results are ads or people who post them for purposes  more than providing info, they have their own agenda and results are biased
